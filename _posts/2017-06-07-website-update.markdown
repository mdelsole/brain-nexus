Hi !

You might not have seen it but we have been busy on the website:

* By popular request: **"Previous" and "Next" buttons** added at the end of each tutorial
* **Download the website as a pdf** [here](/assets/pdf/opengl_tutorial_2017_06_07.pdf) or print it [here](/print/)
* Lots of typo & formatting fixes in english and other language

If you have more ideas of tutorials or stuff that isn't right on the website, **keep the feedback coming**:

* **By submitting PR** in [github](https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl) ! (The website is also there under [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/tree/gh-pages))
* **By email**: <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>
