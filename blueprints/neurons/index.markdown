Every feature we need to incorporate about neurons.

Not even close to a full article right now...


* Neurons are the **fundamental units** from which the functional modules of the brain are assembled.
* Even though there is a great diversity of neurons, they all are derived from one basic cell plan: 
    * Uni-directional signal flow, excitable, and releases neurotransmitters
* Neurons have the ability to **communicate** fast and accurately with other cells that may be far away.
* Neurons have receptive dendrites at one end and a transmitting axon at the other
    * Structural basis for **uni-directional signaling**
* Neuron cell membrane can facilitate the flow of ions, causing electrical currents that alter membrane voltage.
    * Structural basis for **excitability**
    * Can produce a wave of depolarization called an **action potential**
* **Glia** are less excitable, but they facilitate the uptake of neurotransmitter molecules from extracellular space, thus regulating neuronal function.
* There are about 100 distinct types of neurons. 
    * Neurons all inherit the same set of genes, but each expresses a **restricted set** and thus produces only certain molecules.
    * In essence, each cell *is* the set of molecules that makes it up.


Biology
* The cytoplasm of the dendrites and the cell body is shared. In contrast to this continuity, the cell body and the axon hillock (where the axon starts) have a sharp functional boundary.
