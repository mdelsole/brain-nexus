# Introduction

In all biological systems, the basic building block is the cell. Cells are often organized into functional modules that are grouped together to build even more complex systems. The human brain is the most complex example of a modular system.

Complex biological systems have another structural feature: They are **architectonic**. Their anatomy, fine structure, and biochemistry all reflect a specific physiological function. Thus, the construction of the brain and its cell biology all reflect its fundamental function of producing intelligence.

Neurons are the fundamental units from which the functional modules of the brain are assembled. Even though there is a great diversity of neurons, they all are derived from one basic cell plan. This plan has three fundamental features that give neurons the unique ability to communicate with each other quickly and accurately over long distances:

1. The neuron is **polarized**, possessing receptive dendrites on one end and communicative axons with synaptic terminals at the other. This polarization of functional parts restricts the flow of impulses to one direction.
2. The neuron is **excitable**. Its cell membrane has specialized proteins (ion channels and receptors) that allow in and out flow of certain ions, which thus create electrical currents that excite the neuron.
3. The neuron contains protains that give it secretory properties, allowing it to **release neurotransmitters** at its synapses.

In this chapter on neurons, we'll be concerned with that fundamental features 1 and 2: the properties of the neuron that allow it to generate electric signals called action potentials.

# Neurons and Glia

Our entire nervous system is assembled from neurons and glia. These two cells share many characteristics with cells in general, but neurons specifically are endowed with the ability to communicate quickly and accurately with other cells that may be great distances away.

Two features give neurons this ability
