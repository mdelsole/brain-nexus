# Introduction

In all biological systems, the basic building block is the cell. Cells are often organized into functional modules that are grouped together to build even more complex systems. The human brain is the most complex example of a modular system.

Complex biological systems have another structural feature: They are **architectonic**. Their anatomy, fine structure, and biochemistry all reflect a specific physiological function. Thus, the construction of the brain and its cell biology all reflect its fundamental function of producing intelligence.

Neurons are the fundamental units from which the functional modules of the brain are assembled. Even though there is a great diversity of neurons, they all are derived from one basic cell plan. This plan has three fundamental features that give neurons the unique ability to communicate with each other quickly and accurately over long distances:

1. The neuron is **polarized**, possessing receptive dendrites on one end and communicative axons with synaptic terminals at the other. This polarization of functional parts restricts the flow of impulses to one direction.
2. The neuron is **excitable**. Its cell membrane has specialized proteins (ion channels and receptors) that allow in and out flow of certain ions, which thus create electrical currents that excite the neuron.
3. The neuron contains protains that give it secretory properties, allowing it to **release neurotransmitters** at its synapses.

In this chapter on neurons, we'll be concerned with that fundamental features 1 and 2: the properties of the neuron that allow it to generate electric signals called action potentials.

# Neurons and Glia

Our entire nervous system is assembled from neurons and glia. These two cells share many characteristics with cells in general, but neurons specifically are endowed with the ability to communicate quickly and accurately with other cells that may be great distances away.

Two features give neurons this ability to signal: First, they have **asymmetry**, both physically and functionally. Neurons have receptive dendrites at one end and a transmitting axon at the other. This is the structural basis for **uni-directional** neuron signaling. 

Second, neurons are both electrically and chemically **excitable**. The cell membrane of neurons contains specialized poteins (ion channels and receptors) that facilitate the flow of specific ions, redistributing the charge and creating electrical currents that alter the voltage across the membrane. These changes in charge can produce a wave of depolarization called **action potentials** along the axon, which is how signal travels withi the neuron.

Glia are less excitable, but their membranes contain transporter proteins that facilitate the uptake of ions and proteins that remove neurotransmitter molecules from extracellular space, thus regulating neuronal function.

There are about 100 distinct types of neurons, apparent clearly at the molecular level. Although neurons all inherit the same complement of genes, each expresses a restricted set and thus produces only certain molecules. Particular enzymes, proteins, membrane constituents, and secretory products, and not others. In essence, each cell *is* the set of molecules that makes it up.

Neurons and glia share many structural and molecular characteristics. They both develop from common cells of the embryonic nervous system. The boundaries of these cells are defined by the cell membrane, which has the **asymetric bilayer** structure that all biological membranes do. It provides a barrier impermeable to most water-soluble substances, creating an isolated environment within itself. 

Mitochondria generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the major molecule by which cellular energy is transferred or spent. Peroxisomes prevent accumulation of the strong oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. Thought to originate from symbiotic organisms that invaded eukaryotic cells early in evolution, these two organelles are not functionally continuous with the vacuolar apparatus.

Too much biology? Not sure what else to put here...

The cytoplasm of the nerve cell body extends into the dendritic tree without functional differentiation. Generally, all organelles (cell workers like the mitochondria and peroxides) in the cytoplasm of the cell body are also present in dendrites. Dendrites have enoplasmic reticulum prominent at the base of their spines, the receptive portion of excitatory synapses. Concentrations of polyribosomes in dendritic spines serve local protein synthesis.

Unlike the continuity of the cell body and dendrites, there is a sharp functional boundary  between the cell body at the axon hillock (where the axon emerges). Protein synthesizing machinery is generally excluded from axons. However, axons are rich in synaptic vesicles and their precursor membranes.

## Cell Shape

The cytoskeleton determines the shape of a cell, and is responsible for the asymmetric distribution of organelles within the cytoplasm. It has 3 structures within it: microtubules, neurofilaments, and microfilaments.

Microtubles form long scaffolds that extend from one end of the neuron to the other. They develop and maintain cell shape. Think of them like support beams. A single microtubule is about 0.1 mm. They are constructed of tubulin subunits, arranged horizontally along the microtubule. Tubulin subunits bind to neighboring subunits. The negative end of the tubulin units are oriented to the center of the cell, while the positive end is toward the dendrites and axon.

Microtubules undergo rapid cycles of polymerization and depolymerization in dividng cells, but in mature dendrites and eaxons they are much more stable. In Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative disorders, tau proteins are modific and abnormally polymerized, forming lesions.

## Protein Transportation

In neurons, most proteins are made in the cell body from mRNAs. Because axons and synaptic terminals at the ends of them often lie great distances from the cell body, there needs to be mechanisms for transporting function to these remote regions.

The axon terminal, the site most important for neuron signaling, is very distant from the cell body. In motor neurons for example, the distance can be up to 10,000 times the cell-body diameter. Passive diffusion is way too slow to deliver the molecules needed. They must be **actively transported** to the end of the axon.

There are two speeds of **axoplasmic flow**. The first is **fast axonal transport**, which transports membraneous organelles (workers like the mitochondira). It transports these organelles both toward the terminal and back toward the cell body. The backwards part is especially impotant in nerve regeneration and axon growth. The other speed is **slow axonal transport**, which facilitates movement of organelles in all secretory cells.

## Glial Cells

Let us recall glial cells from the overview section of this guide. Like neurons, there are many different types of glia. Broadly, they can be divided into two major classes: **microglia** and **macroglia**. Microglia are immune system cells designed to present antigens during injury and infenction. Macroglia are the important ones; about 80% of all cells in the human brain are macroglia.

There are three main types of macroglia: **oligodendrocytes**, **Schwann cells**, and **astrocytes**. The names are...difficult to remember. Of the 80% macroglia cells in the human brain, around 50% are Oligodendrocytes, and 50% are Astrocytes. Schwann cells are used by sensory receptor neurons across the body.

The main job of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells is to provide the insulating material called myelin that allows rapid conduction of electrical signals along the axon. Both types of glia prouduce myelin only for *segments* of axons. Axons are *not* continuously wrapped in myeling. Surprisingly, this features facilitates action potentials. More on that in later chapters though. Schwann cells produce one myelin sheath for one segment of one axon. Oligodendrocytes however produce sheathes for segments of up to 30 axons.
