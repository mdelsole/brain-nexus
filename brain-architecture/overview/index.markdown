# Introduction

Welcome to the brain architecture section! Here, we will learn everything humans know about how our brain works.

# The Brain

The brain is an extremely large system. At its most basic level, it is made up of **neurons**. These are the basic computational unit of the brain. A neuron by itself is quite usless; only when it is connected to another neuron via **synapses** does it start to have functionality. The brain has over 10,000,000,000 of these neurons, each interacting with each other with about 10,000 synapses. That's over 1 trillion different connections! 

Obviously, it would be impossible to try to understand what each individual neuron in the brain does. Fortunately for us, the brain has a *core set of principles* that it operates with. Most of our neural processing comes from a few simple mechanics repeated over and over. Throughout this section, we'll learn how this core set of principles emerges from the basic biological properties of neurons and synapses.

# Parts of the Brain

The brain has two main parts: the "new" brain, called the **neocortex**, and the "old" brain, which is everything not in the neocortex. The distinction between these two is fundamental to understanding how exactly we humans operate.

Most of our intelligence comes from the neocortex. Meanwhile, most of our basic life functions (breathing, hunger, etc.) come from our old brain. There is a large host of interconnectivty between the two, and the line can become messy at times, but it is nevertheless a useful distinction.

At the core of our brain, we have a reptilian brain. On the evolutionary tree, reptiles are at the bottom.

On this site, we will focus mostly on the neocortex. We will of course cover relevant parts of the old brain, but a large portion of it is made up of hard-coded systems; nerve cell connections built in to our DNA. In contrast, the neocortex is where most learning happens. It is extremely plastic, and changes throughout our entire life. 

My goal with this website is determine the blueprints for intelligence, and the new brain is the best place to focus on that. From here on out, assume that when I use generic terms like "neurons", I'm talking solely about neurons in the neocortex; rules will differ in the old brain.

# The Neocortex

The neocortex is where the real magic of human intelligence happens. Many professors and books try to divide the neocortex (sometimes shortened to just **cortex**) into different regions. They'll tell you it has the "occiptal lobe", the "temporal lobe", and so on. 

Unfortunately, such distinctions aren't very useful. Many functions (if not all) reach across many different areas. Trying to isolate them by saying things like "decision-making happens in the orbito-frontal cortex" is misleading, and often just plain wrong. In this guide, instead of breaking things into sections of the brain and what mental functions they contribute to, we'll break things into mental functions and what sections of the brain they involve.

The neocortex's rapid evolution is what we can attribute our success as humans to. All mammals have a neocortex, but the human neocortex is much more elaborate than, say, the rat's neocortex. What made this rapid evolution possible is that the neocortex is essentially **the same** everywhere. It has many different areas, but they all share one common architecture. The only difference is what the areas are hooked up to.

To show you just how uniform it is, we can take a look at a study done by Sharma et al. [1]. Here, they took the retinal signals from the eyes of ferrets and hooked them up to the auditory pathway, the region of the neocortex involved in processing sounds. Amazingly, the ferrets could learn to see. This is only possible because the way the neocortex learns is the same everywhere. 

This is good news for us who want to understand the brain because it means there's really only one central learning algorithm responsible for our ability to understand things, even if it's complicated. 

We'll see throughout this guide that the neocortex interacts with the old brain to give us the full range of mental functions we enjoy. Both are parts of the brain are equally important to human survival, but the neocortex is much more important to human intelligence.
