# Introduction

Welcome to the brain architecture section! Here, we will learn everything humans know about how our brain works.

# The Brain

The brain is an extremely large system. At its most basic level, it is made up of **neurons**. These are the basic computational unit of the brain. A neuron by itself is quite usless; only when it is connected to another neuron via **synapses** does it start to have functionality. The brain has over 10,000,000,000 of these neurons, each interacting with each other with about 10,000 synapses. That's over 1 trillion different connections! 

Obviously, it would be impossible to try to understand what each individual neuron in the brain does. Fortunately for us, the brain has a *core set of principles* that it operates with. Most of our neural processing comes from a few simple mechanics repeated over and over. Throughout this section, we'll learn how this core set of principles emerges from the basic biological properties of neurons and synapses.

# The Central Nervous System

There are five main parts to the central nervous system, together which make up our entire network of communication and intelligence across our body.

We begin with the **spinal cord**. This piece is in charge of recieving the sensory information from skin, joints, muscles, etc. all over the body and *sending* it up to the brain. Most things in the nervous system are *bi-directional*, and the spinal cord is no exception; It is also in charge of *recieving* signals from brain and using them to control the movement of your limbs. If you lose your spinal cord, good luck controlling your body.

The spinal cord connects to the **brain stem**, which is the big super-highway between your body and your brain. Additionally, it plays a role in motor control for the head and regulating how alert/awake you are. 

The brain stem has 3 distinct parts: the **medulla oblongata**, the **pons** and the **midbrain**. The medulla oblongata controls vital basic life functions like digestion, breathing, and heart rate. The pons is in charge of conveying movement information from the "main brain" to the cerebellum. The midbrain handles most of the sensory and motor signals.

The **cerebellum** is another part. It's right behind the brain stem, connected to both the "main brain" and the brain stem. It modulates motor control and is used in learning movement-related skills.

Past the brain stem and the adjacent cerebellum lies the **diencephalon**. This structure contains two parts: the *thalamus* and the *hypothalamus* (literally meaning "under thalamus"). 

The thalamus is in charge of pre-processing information between the cerebal cortex and the rest of the central nervous system. Think of it as a giant switchboard for communication between the "main brain" and the body. The hypothalamus is in charge of more basic body functions, like the autonmic, endocrine, and visceral systems.

I've used the term *"main brain"* a few times here, but what exactly is it? It's the final part of the nervous system, the **cerebrum**. When you think of the brain, you probably think of this. This is where intelligence happens. The cerebrum has two parts: the very wrinkly outer layer called the **cerebral cortex**, and three deeply-buried parts called the **basal ganglia**, the **hippocampus**, and the **amygdala**.

In humans, almost all of the cerebral cortex is the **neocortex**. The distinction of neocortex ("neo" literally meaning "new") is the parts we humans have that most other mammals (like rodents) don't. The remaining "old" portion of the cerebral cortex is mostly our *olefactory* system in charge of processing smells, so you can probably figure why all mammals would have that and it's not a "new" part of the brain.

The cerebrum can be further divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The distinct mechanics of having two hemispheres instead of one will be discussed later on.

The buried parts of the cerebrum are very important. The *basal ganglia* regulate motor performance by learning from reward/punishment and shaping action selection. The *hippocampus* is crucial for memory storage and by extension, learning in general. The *amygdala* is important for signals tied to emotional states.

These five parts of the nervous system, the spinal cord, brain stem, cerebellum, diencephalon, and cerebrum, together are responsible for everything humans have been able to accomplish. We would be nothing without their abilities. Throughout the rest of this guide, we will explore the function and mechanisms of each part.

# Cognitive Abilities are Localized

Through the use of brain imagery, it is now clear that cognitive abilities arise from specific regions in the brain. These regions are the same in nearly everyone; damage to the same brain areas consistently causes the same deficits in cognitive abilities across many different people.

The place most responsible for our advanced cognitive abilities is the **cerebral cortex**. The cerebral cortex is often divided into four lobes based on the dividing skull bones: the *frontal*, *parietal*, *temporal*, and *occipital* lobes. The material of each of these lobes is in the form of wrinkly infoldings, an evolutionary starategy for packing more neurons into a tight space.

Neuroscientists have taken a liking to these wrinkles, and name regions based off of them. The crests are referred to as *gyri* (plural for *gyrus*), and the grooves are called *sulci*. Regions are named based on which gyrus or sulci they are located on, such as the *precentral gyrus*.

The lobes themselves have specialized functions too. The *frontal* lobe handles short-term memory, planning future actions, and controlling movement. The *parietal* lobe is involved in your mental representation of your body and its place in the world around you. The temporal lobe is concerned with memory, learning, ane emotion, containing both the hippocampus and the amygdala. The occipital lobe is in charge of vision, the most pronounced sense humans have.

The cerebral cortex is also divided into two hemispheres. Oddly, each hemisphere is concerned with the sensory/motor information of the *opposite* side of the body; since most people are right-handed, they are left-brain dominant. Additionally, although they are similar in appearance, the hemispheres are not completely equivelant in function.

Before moving on, it's important to note that hardly any function in the brain is entirely localized to one specific place. Most areas have a specialization, but the real power of the brain lies in the communcation between different areas. As a result, many functions arise from the *interaction* and *integration* of signals from multiple areas.



# The Neocortex

The neocortex is where the real magic of human intelligence happens. Many professors and books try to divide the neocortex (sometimes shortened to just **cortex**) into different regions. They'll tell you it has the "occiptal lobe", the "temporal lobe", and so on. Unfortunately, such distinctions aren't very accurate. Many functions (if not all) reach across many different areas. Trying to isolate them by saying things like "decision-making happens in the orbito-frontal cortex" is misleading, and often just plain wrong. 

However, that's not to say that specific regions don't contribute to specific functions. In fact, quite the contrary. The first evidence we had of such phenomenon comes from **aphasia**, a language disorder that results in specific parts of language abilities being disabled due to damage to specific brain regions (usually due to stroke or surgery). But to say that these abilities are *solely* the product of a specifc brain region is not a useful simplification.

In this guide, instead of breaking things into sections of the brain and what mental functions they contribute to, we'll break things into mental functions and what sections of the brain they involve.

The neocortex's rapid evolution is what we can attribute our success as humans to. All mammals have a neocortex, but the human neocortex is much more elaborate than, say, the rat's neocortex. What made this rapid evolution possible is that the neocortex is essentially **the same** everywhere. It has many different areas, but they all share one common architecture. The only difference is what the areas are hooked up to.

To show you just how uniform it is, we can take a look at a study done by Sharma et al. [1]. Here, they took the retinal signals from the eyes of ferrets and hooked them up to the auditory pathway, the region of the neocortex involved in processing sounds. Amazingly, the ferrets could learn to see. This is only possible because the way the neocortex learns is the same everywhere. 

This is good news for us who want to understand the brain because it means there's really only one central learning algorithm responsible for our ability to understand things, even if it's complicated. 

We'll see throughout this guide that the neocortex interacts with the old brain to give us the full range of mental functions we enjoy. Both are parts of the brain are equally important to human survival, but the neocortex is much more important to human intelligence.
