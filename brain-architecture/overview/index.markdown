# Introduction

Welcome to the brain architecture section! Here, we will learn everything humans know about how our brain works.

In this initial overview section, I will provide a broad overview of the key features of the brain. We'll discuss the central nervous system and its cells, along with the genes that give rise to our behavior.

# The Brain

The brain is an extremely large system. At its most basic level, it is made up of **neurons**. These are the basic computational unit of the brain. A neuron by itself is quite usless; only when it is connected to another neuron via **synapses** does it start to have functionality. The brain has over 10,000,000,000 of these neurons, each interacting with each other with about 10,000 synapses. That's over 1 trillion different connections! 

Obviously, it would be impossible to try to understand what each individual neuron in the brain does. Fortunately for us, the brain has a *core set of principles* that it operates with. Most of our neural processing comes from a few simple mechanics repeated over and over. Throughout this guide, we'll learn how this core set of principles emerges from the basic biological properties of neurons and synapses.

## The Central Nervous System

There are five main parts to the central nervous system, together which make up our entire network of communication and intelligence across our body.

We begin with the **spinal cord**. This piece is in charge of recieving the sensory information from skin, joints, muscles, etc. all over the body and *sending* it up to the brain. Most things in the nervous system are *bi-directional*, and the spinal cord is no exception; It is also in charge of *recieving* signals from brain and using them to control the movement of your limbs. If you lose your spinal cord, good luck controlling your body.

The spinal cord connects to the **brain stem**, which is the big super-highway between your body and your brain. Additionally, it plays a role in motor control for the head, regulating how alert/awake you are, and controlling basic life functions.

The brain stem has 3 distinct parts: the **medulla oblongata**, the **pons** and the **midbrain**. The medulla oblongata controls vital basic life functions like digestion, breathing, and heart rate. The pons is in charge of conveying movement information from the "main brain" to the cerebellum. The midbrain handles most of the sensory and motor signals.

The **cerebellum** is another part. It's right behind the brain stem, connected to both the "main brain" and the brain stem. It modulates motor control and is used in learning movement-related skills.

Past the brain stem and the adjacent cerebellum lies the **diencephalon**. This structure contains two parts: the *thalamus* and the *hypothalamus* (literally meaning "under thalamus"). 

The thalamus is in charge of pre-processing information between the cerebal cortex and the rest of the central nervous system. Think of it as a giant switchboard for communication between the "main brain" and the body. The hypothalamus is in charge of more basic body functions, like the autonmic, endocrine, and visceral systems.

I've used the term *"main brain"* a few times here, but what exactly is it? It's the final part of the nervous system, the **cerebrum**. When you think of the brain, you probably think of this. This is where intelligence happens. The cerebrum has two parts: the very wrinkly outer layer called the **cerebral cortex**, and three deeply-buried parts called the **basal ganglia**, the **hippocampus**, and the **amygdala**.

In humans, almost all of the cerebral cortex is the **neocortex**. The distinction of neocortex ("neo" literally meaning "new") is the parts we humans have that most other mammals (like rodents) don't. The remaining "old" portion of the cerebral cortex is mostly our *olefactory* system in charge of processing smells, so you can probably figure why all mammals would have that and it's not a "new" part of the brain.

The cerebrum can be further divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The distinct mechanics of having two hemispheres instead of one will be discussed later on.

The buried parts of the cerebrum are very important. The *basal ganglia* regulate motor performance by learning from reward/punishment and shaping action selection. The *hippocampus* is crucial for memory storage and by extension, learning in general. The *amygdala* is important for signals tied to emotional states.

These five parts of the nervous system, the spinal cord, brain stem, cerebellum, diencephalon, and cerebrum, together are responsible for everything humans have been able to accomplish. We would be nothing without their abilities. Throughout the rest of this guide, we will explore the function and mechanisms of each part.

## The Localization of Cognitive Abilities

Through the use of brain imagery, it is now clear that cognitive abilities arise from specific regions in the brain. These regions are the same in nearly everyone; damage to the same brain areas consistently causes the same deficits in cognitive abilities across many different people.

The place most responsible for our advanced cognitive abilities is the **cerebral cortex**. The cerebral cortex is often divided into four lobes based on the dividing skull bones: the **frontal**, **parietal**, **temporal**, and **occipital** lobes. The material of each of these lobes is in the form of wrinkly infoldings, an evolutionary starategy for packing more neurons into a tight space.

Neuroscientists have taken a liking to these wrinkles, and name regions based off of them. The crests are referred to as **gyri** (plural for *gyrus*), and the grooves are called **sulci**. Regions are named based on which gyrus or sulci they are located on, such as the *precentral gyrus*.

The lobes themselves have specialized functions too. The *frontal* lobe handles short-term memory, planning future actions, and controlling movement. The *parietal* lobe is involved in your mental representation of your body and its place in the world around you. The *temporal* lobe is concerned with memory, learning, ane emotion, containing both the hippocampus and the amygdala. The *occipital* lobe is in charge of vision, the most pronounced sense humans have.

The cerebral cortex is also divided into two hemispheres. Oddly, each hemisphere is concerned with the sensory/motor information of the *opposite* side of the body; since most people are right-handed, they are left-brain dominant. 

Additionally, although they are similar in appearance, the hemispheres are not completely equivelant in function. There's a popular pseudo-science about whether you're a "left-brain" or a "right-brain", but it has little evidence. Yes, the right brain often processes emotional aspects and the left brain often processes logical aspects, but there's hardly any evidence to say people specialize in one side over the other.

Despite the fact neuroscientists have been able to provide a plethora of evidence for specific brain regions being responsible for certain cognitive abilities, the idea has never been able to convince many when it comes to emotions. 

Many flat-out believe that emotions are governed on a different plane of existence and can't be explained be science (especially that super powerful one called *love*). Even of those who concede emotions are produced by our brain, many believe they are an expression of whole-brain activity. The evidence, however, is on the contrary. They might not be mapped as precisely as our sensory or motor systems, but distinct emotions *can* be elicited by stimulating specific parts of the brain.

## The Interaction of Cognitive Abilities

It's important to note that hardly any function in the brain is entirely localized to one specific place. Most areas have a specialization, but the real power of the brain lies in the communcation between different areas. As a result, many functions arise from the **interaction** and **integration** of signals from multiple areas.

Although there was a time when it was unclear, we now know that all cognitive abilities result from the *interaction* of many different brain regions, each specializing in certain processing. Specific brain regions do not produce our cognitive abilities, but rather act as **basic processing units** that fit into a large web of interconnectivity. 

Consider the concept of a cat. When you think of a cat, everything you know about cats seems to be stored as one complete representation; what they look like, what they sound like, what they like to eat, etc. But in reality, your knowledge of cats is divided into distinct **categories** and stored separately.

One region of your brain stores the information about the physical features that trigger your visual recognition of cats. The sound that cats make is stored separately, and what that sound might mean (they're hungry or they want attention) is stored elsewhere. It's not a single cell that represents what a cat is; it's a large **gestalt** containing every piece of information about cats.

### Consciousness

Perhaps the best example is the organization of your sense of self; the self-aware being that is thought of when you say "I". This coherence is achieved through the connection of independent circuits in our two hemishperes, each with its own sense of awareness. 

The discovery was made when studying patients whose **corpus callosum** (the major bundle connecting the two hemispheres) had been severed. Amazingly, it was found that each hemisphere had a consciousness and was able to function **independently** of the other.

A great example is of one patient who was reading his favorite book in his left hand. The left hand is controlled by the right hemisphere, which cannot read (logical processing is done by the left hemisphere). The right hemisphere found just looking at the book to be boring, and commanded the left hand to put the book away. Each hemisphere has a mind of its own.

# Neurons

The sophisticated cognitive abilities of humans depend on one simple concept: the ability to select from the stream of input signals which ones are important to the individual. The brain actively organizes perception, with some immediately transformed into a behavioral response and others stored in memory for future reference. This and all other abilities it enables is accmplished by the interconnectivity of neurons.

Neurons are the fundamental basic unit of the brain. We each have around 100 billion of them, and at least 1000 different types. However, it's not so much the variety that matters, but rather their creation of **circuits** that enables complex functions. In other words, neurons of the same type can produce different actions because of the way they are connected in a circuit.

Obviously, with 100 billion neurons, it would be impossible to identify the function of every individual neuron in the brain. Fortunately, there are just a few simple principles that give rise to the wide array of complex behavior we humans are capable of. It essentially boils down to three basic concepts:

1. The structure and mechanisms of **individual neurons**
2. The patterns of connectivity between neurons via **synapses**, and how they are modified by experience
3. The emergent behavior created by the heirarchical **network** of interconnectivity between neurons and their synapses 

Throughout this guide, we will explore these three concepts and how they enable our cognitive abilities.

## The Neuron

Neurons are the **signaling** units of the nervous system. They have three distinct parts: 
1. The dendrites
2. The cell body
3. The axon 

The **cell body**, sometimes called the *soma*, is the center of the cell. It contains the nucleus, which contains the genes of the cell and is where the cell's proteins are synthesized. Flowing into the cell body are **dendrites**, which are the main structure for receiving incoming signals from other neurons. Flowing out of the cell body is the **axon**. The axon usually extends some distance  from the cell body (from 0.1 mm up to 2 m) and delivers signals to other neurons. 

A **synapse** is the connection from one neuron to another. They are made up of two parts: The *pre-synaptic* terminal, emerging from the ends of the axon, and the *post-synaptic* dendrite. The pre-synaptic neuron's axon sends a signal down the synaptic terminal, while the post-synaptic neuron's dendrites recieve that signal. They meet each other at a junction called the **synaptic cleft**. The pre-synaptic neuron will send signals to many different post-synaptic neurons, just as the post-synaptic neuron will recieve signals from many different pre-synaptic neurons.

These electirc signals delivered between neurons are called **action potentials**. They are triggered near the base of the axon in an area called the *initial segment*, and propagate down the axon, being sent to all the connected post-synaptic neurons. 

Action potential is an all-or-nothing signal; it is a constant 100 mV, and either gets sent or doesn't. There is no variation in the value based on stronger stimulus strength. Instead, as we will see later on, it is the **rate** at which a neuron fires action potentials that determines the signal strength.

Action potentials are the key feature that allows the brain to receive and analyze information. The genius of the nervous system is that these signals can convey any type of information in a uniform way, from heat sensors to light waves. All information is converted into a universal form that the brain can analyze and interpret.

Because our cognitive abilities rely so heavily on these action potentials, the speed at which they are conducted is highly important. To achieve high speed, axons are wrapped in an insulating sheath of fat called **myelin**.

A key principle neurons have is that of **connectional specificity**. This states that neurons do not connect randomly with other neurons when forming networks. Each cell makes specific connections with certain post-synaptic targets.

### Classes of Neurons

There is one feature that most distinguishes one type of neuron from another: its **form**. Specifically, the number of process arising from the cell body. Using this, neurons can be classified into three larger groups: unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar. The difference arises in how many trunks, often called *processes*, the neurons have.

**Unipolar** neurons are the simplest form. They have a single primary trunk that gives rise to many branches. One branch is the axon, and the other branches are the dendrites. In invertebrates like snails and worms, these are the most predominate cell. In vertebrates, they are mainly found in the *autonomic*  nerovus system (internal organs like heart and kidney).

**Bipolar** neurons have an oval-shaped cell body that enables two distinct trunks: a dendritic trunk that recieves signals from the sensory receptors of the body, and an axon trunk that carries information toward the central nervous system. Bipolar neurons are mainly *sensory* neurons, like those in the retina and the olefactory epithelium (smelling place).

The receptor neurons that signal pressure, touch, and pain to the spinal cord aren't technically bipolar cells, but rather *psuedo-unipolar* cells. They initially develop as bipolar cells, but the two trunks eventually fuse and become a single continuous structure. The axon splits into two branches, one going from the skin/muscle receptors and one going to the spinal cord.

**Multipolar** neurons are the most predominate type in vertebrates (such as humans). When you think of neurons, you usually think of these. They have a single axon trunk, and many dendritic trunks emerging from various points around the cell body. They can vary widely in the extent of their denritic branches. A spinal motor neuron might have as few as 10,000 neuron inflowing connections, while a Purkinje cell of the cerebellum can have up to 1,000,000 inflowing connections.

[Insert picture]

Beyond their form, neurons can be classified into three major **functional** categories: sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. 

**Sensory** neurons carry information from the body's sensory receptors (sometimes called peripheral sensors) into the nervous system, for both the purpose of perception and motor coordination. **Motor** neurons carry commands from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles. In general, we call sensory receptors flowing into the nervous system *afferents* and motor information flowing out of the nervous system *efferents*.

**Interneurons** are the most prominant. They can further be divided into two sub-categories: *relay* and *local*. Relay, sometimes called projection, interneurons have extremely long axons that are meant for conveying signals over considerable distances, across different brain regions. Local interneurons have short axons and form connections with nearby neurons to form local circuits.

If we wanted to keep going, we could subdivide all the classifications further, into location, size, density, etc. For example, retinal ganglion cells (interneurons) are classified into 13 types based on the size of their dendritic tree. However, further classification is not strictly necessary to understand the emergent behavior. Just knowing the 6 groups I mentioned above is sufficient to understanding how things work.

## Glial cells

Neurons are the main work horse of the nervous system, but there are actually two main types of cells in the nervous system: Nerve cells, called **neurons**, and glial cells, called **glia**. 

Glial cells were once thought to be much more numerous than nerve cells (up to 10 times the amount), but over time it has become more clear that they are much closer in numbers. Generally, the brain has about 85 billion neurons and 85 billion glia. Glia is greek for *glue*, but the name is a little misleading. Glia don't really hold neuorns together, but rather surround them, filling in the gaps between them. 

Glia aren't electrically excitable, and are not directly involved in signaling. They're more of a *supporter* class of nervous system cells. They enable neurons to form correctly. It's not strictly necessary to know them if your goal is just to understand how the brain works, but for completeness sake, here we go.

Like neurons, there are many different types of glia. Broadly, they can be divided into two major classes: microglia and macroglia. **Microglia** are immune system cells designed to present antigens during injury and infenction. **Macroglia** are the important ones; about 80% of all cells in the human brain are macroglia. 

There are three main types of macroglia: oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and astrocytes. The names are...difficult to remember. Of the 80% macroglia cells in the human brain, around 50% are Oligodendrocytes, and 50% are Astrocytes. Schwann cells are used by sensory receptor neurons across the body.

**Oligodendrocytes** and **Schwann cells** are small cells with few branches. They are responsible for forming the myelin sheath that insulates an axon. They do so like a spider spinning a web, tightly winding their membrane branches around the axon. Oligodendrocytes mainly handle the brain, while Schwann cells mainly handle sensory receptors. The myelin sheath is important, as it enhances the signal conductions and segregates the sensitive ion channels into isolated domains.

**Astrocytes** have a large amount of processes (trunks), and look like stars (hence the 'astro-'). *Protopolasmic* astrocytes are found in gray matter, while *fibrous* astrocytes are found in white matter. We still aren't sure exactly what astrocytes are essential for, but they definitely support neurons in a few ways:
1. They separate cells, insulating neuron groups and synaptic connections from each other.
2. They help regulate K+ concentration in the space between neurons. As we'll soon learn, K+ flows out of neurons when they fire. The astrocytes clean up the excess K+.
3. They perform other housekeeping, such as taking up neurotransmitters.
4. They help nourish surrounding neurons by releasing growth factors.

Glial cells might not be the main workers, but their support is nonetheless valuable. We'll discuss in later chapters how they may even help regulate synapse development and function.

## Neuron Circuitry

The behavioral function of every neuron is determined by its connections with other neurons. A single neuron can activate many target cells, a property called **divergence**, and can also recieve many cellular inputs, a property called **convergence**. 

Divergence allows a single neuron to exert a wide and diverse influence. Convergence allows a neuron to integrate information from many sources. It also ensure that a motor neuron is activated only if a sufficient number of sensory neurons become activated together, effectively filtering out insignificant noise.

Another important feature of the nervous system is that not all signals are excitatory. Many neurons produce **inhibitory** signals that reduce other neurons' ability to fire. In nearly all cases, especially in the neocortex, inhibitory signals can only be produced by inhibitory neurons; a neuron can't produce both excitatory signals and inhibitory signals. 

Inhibition can be either **feedforward** or **feedback**, both of which serve to balance the system. Feedfoward inihibtion *enhances* the effect of the active pathway by supreessing the activity of other pathways (usually pathways which excite opposing actions). The excitatory neuron connects to an inhibitory interneuron, in addition to the neurons it is trying to excite, inhibiting the pathway that the inhibitory interneuron is connected to.

[insert picture]

Feedback inhibition is a *self-regulating* mechanism. An excitatory neuron will connect to an inhibitory neuron, which in turn will connect back to the excitatory neuron in a loop, effectively making the excitatory neuron inhibit itself. The purpose is to dampen the activity and prevent it from exceeding a critical level. We'll talk more about this later, but without this, your muscles would rip themselves to shreds and you'd have constant seizures.

## Neuron Signaling

The primary function of a neuron is to produce a signal that travels to other neurons. Interestingly, regardless of cell size/shape, biochemistry, behavioral function, etc., almost all neurons can have their signaling described in the same way. There are 4 different signals that must be generated in sequence for the signaling process to be successful: an input signal, a trigger signal, a conducting signal, and an output signal.

In order to be able to generate these four signals, the model neuron must have 4 core components: a **receptive** component, an **integrative** component, a **long-range signaling** component, and a **secretory** component.

The different types of signals generated in a neuron are determined by the intrinsic electrical proprerties of the **cell membrane**. In all cells, the cell membrane serves to isolate the cell from the outside world, allowing its internals to go about their own processes. Cells maintain a difference in the electric potential inside and outside of their membrane. 

Neurons are no different. In neurons, this is called the **resting membrane potential**, and is the value of the internal voltage of a neuron when not active. It's a *relative* value: typically the voltage inside the cell is 65 mV more negative than the outside of the cell. In many, the outside voltage is 0, so the typical resting membrane potential of a neuron is -65 mV.

The value is different for different nerve cells, usually ranging from -40 mV to -80 mV depending on their type. Muscle cells are the greatest at -90 mV, presumably to lower the chance of the wrong muscle cells accidentally becoming active. 

This resting membrane potential value results from two factors: **unequal distribution** of positively charged ions (Na+ and K+) on either side of the membrane, and the **selective permeability** of the membrane.

Unequal distribution of positively charged ions Na+ and K+ is largely controlled by a membrane protein that actively pumps Na+ *out* of the cell and K+ back *into* it. This **Na+ K+ pump** keeps internal Na+ concentrations low (1/10 outside value) and K+ concentrations high (20x outside value). Your kidneys are in charge of maintaining the concetrations outside the cell.

Cell membrane is mostly impermeable (ions can't flow in and out of it), but it is selectively permeable to K+. The membrane has proteins that form pores called **ion channels**, which allow certain ions to pass through. When the cell is at rest, channels that are highly permeable to K+ become active. K+ ions **leak** out of these open channels, downing the ion's concentration, and by extension downing the membrane potential. As K+ ions exit the cell, they leave behind a cloud of negative charge on the inner surface of the membrane, adding to the membrane being more negative than the outside.

If you're wondering why I bolded the word "leak", it's because that leak is one of three main determining forces of a neuron's membrane potential. More on that down the road though.

A neuron is "excitable" when its neuron membrane potential can be quickly and significantly altered. This change is the mechanism by which neurons signal. 

Inputs to the neuron reduce the membrane potential, making it much more permeable to Na+ than K+. This influx of Na+ neutralizes the negative charge inside the cell and causes a breif explosive change in membrane potential to +40 mV. This change is called the **action potential** (i.e. the electrical potential is undergoing action). 

It is conducted down the cell's axon to the axon terminal, where it can be used to communicate with other neurons and muscle cells. An action potential typically lasts about 1 ms, after which the membrane potential returns to its resting state. Neurons also produce local receptor and synaptic potentials that are not actively propagated and decay within just a few millimeters, but they are unimporant.

The change in membrane potential that generates action potentials can be either a decrease or an increase from the resting potential. It is a *baseline* on which all the neuron's signaling occurs. A reduction is called **depolarization**. Depolarization enhances a cell's ability to generate an action potential, and thus is excitatory. An increase in membrane potential is called **hyperpolarization**. Hyperpolarization makes a cell less likely to generate an action potential and is therefore inhibitory.

Remember, we're dealing with negative values here. A reduction actually means less negative, i.e. more positive (e.g. -65 mV to -55 mV). An increase means more negative. Hyperpolarized cells are least likely to fire since they have the most change required to fire, while depolarized cells are most likely to fire since they have the least change required to fire.

## Neuron Input

When neurons are at rest, no current flows, so the resting potential is the same throughout the cell. To become activated, a neuron needs current to flow into it.

In sensory neurons, flow is typically initiated by a physical stimulus. The stimulus activates specialized receptor proteins at the receptive surface, triggering the neurons. Specific ion channels are opened in response, allowing the rapid influx of Na+ ions into the sensory neuron. This current caused by these ions changes the membrane potential, producing a local signal called the **receptor potential**.

The amplitude and duration of the receptor potential depend on the intensity of the stimulus. Importantly, unlike the action potential which is all or nothing, receptor potentials are **graded**, having multiple levels of intensity. Most receptor potentials are excitatory (depolarizing), though inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) ones are found in the retina.

The receptor potential is the first representation of the stimulus to be coded in the nervous system. However, this signal spreads *passively*, and doesn't travel more than 1 to 2 mm. To be carried to the rest of the nervous system, the signal must be amplified; it must cause the cell to *generate* an **action potential**. If the receptor potential is large enough, it triggers an action potential which is *actively* propagated to the central nervous system.

Sensory neurons are most often connected to interneurons. The action potential of the sensory neuron produces a chain of events that results in an *input signal* to the interneuron. The action potential in the pre-synaptic terminal of the sensory neuron initiates the release of a chemical substance called a **neurotransmitter** into the synatic cleft (the junction where the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic terminals meet). After travelling across the cleft, the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor proteins in the post-synaptic membrane of the interneuron, opening ion channels. 

The ensuing flow of current changes the membrane potential of the interneuron, a change called the **synaptic potential**. The pre-synaptic neuron sends the action potential, and the synaptic potential is how much of that action potential actually reached the post-synaptic neuron. We'll see later how it is modified by several factors, mainly the strength of the synapse itself. The synaptic potential can have either a depolarizing or hyperpolarizing effect on the cell, depending on the type of receptor molecule that is activated.

Before moving on, let's summarize. A stimulus comes in (e.g. you touch a table). The stimulus is picked up by your sensory neurons, generating a *receptor potential*, which is a change in the membrane potential of your sensory neurons. If the receptor potential is big enough, it triggers an *action potential*. This action potential travels along the synapse to neurons connected to the sensory neuron. This action potential causes a change in the membrane potential of the post-synaptic neuron(s) called a *synaptic potential*. If the synaptic potential is large enough, it will cause the post-synaptic neuron to also fire an action potential, starting the chain of brain activity.

While receptor and synaptic potentials are essentially the same thing (input causing a change in receiving neuron's membrane potential), we differentiate them because they have different mechanics of how the signal is generated and communicated. We'll discuss these mechanics in later sections.

## Action Potentials
 
The action potential is an all-or-nothing signal. Stimuli below the certain **threshold** do not produce a signal, and all stimuli above the threshold produce signals of the *same amplitude*. Even though the stimuli may vary in intensity and duration, the amplitude and duration of the action potential are pretty much the same. 

Unlike receptor and synaptic potentials, which spread passively and decrease gradually, action potentials do not decay as they travel along the axon to their target. This is because it is *peridocially regenerated*. The distance an action potential travels can be as far as 2 m, and can go as fast as 100 m/s.

The remarkable feature of action potentials is that they are nearly all the same, varying only subtly from one nerve cell to another. Action potentials carried into the nervous system by sensory axons are often indistinguishable from those carried out of the nervous system to the muscles by motor axons.

If all action potentials are the same, how do they communicate different stimuli intensities? There are two features of the action potential that convey information: the **number** of action potentials, and the **time intervals** between them. All signals are much alike, whether the message is destined to arouse the sensation of light, of tough, or of pain. What's important is their **frequency**. If they signals are crowded together, the sensation is intense. If they are separated by long intervals, the sensation is feeble. What determines the intensity of sensation or speed of muscle is their frequency. By extension, the duration of the sensation or movement is determined by the time period over which the action potentials are generated.

In addtion to the frequency, the **pattern** of action potentials can also convey important information. For example, some neurons are not silent in the absence of stimulation, but are spontaneously active. Some spontaneoulsy active cells fire action potentials regularly (called beating neurons). Other neurons fire in brief bursts (called bursting neurons). These different types of neurons will fire differently in response to the same excitatory synaptic input: In a non-spontaneously active cell, an excitatory signal may initiate an action potential (or several), but in spontaneously active cells that same input will *modulate the rhythm* by increasing the rate of firing of the action potentials.

An even bigger difference can be seen with inhibitory signals. Inhibitory inputs have little information value when they are input to a silent cell. However, in spontaneously active cells, inhibition can have a very powerful sculpting role. The inhibitory signal establishes periods of silence in otherwise constant activity. Through this, inhibition can produce a complex pattern of alternating firing and silence. These subtle differences in firing patterns have functional consequences for the information transfer between neurons, which we will discuss in later sections.

Still, you may be asking, if all action potentials are nearly the same, how can they carry the wide variety of information that we need in our every-day lives? The answer is one of the most important organizational principles in the brain: Pathways of connected neurons, not individual neurons convey the information. Interconnected neurons form anatomically and functionally distinct pathways. It's similar to how our computers, which can do everything from playing movies to accessing the internet, only have one fundamental signal: 1's and 0's. In the same way a computer's functionality is made from combining those 1's and 0's in many different ways, our brain's functionality is made from combining those action potentials in many different ways through the vast web of synaptic connections.

## Neuron Differences: The Molecular Level

The model of neural signaling that has been layed out here is a simplification. It applies to most neurons, but there are some important variations. For example, some neurons do not generate action potentials. These are typically local interneurons without a conductive component; they have no axon (or such a short one that regeneration of the signal is not required). In these neurons, the input signals are summed and spread passively to the presynaptic temrinal where neraby neurotransmitter is released. Spontaneously active neurons do not require sensory or synaptic inputs to fire, because they have a special class of ion channels that permit Na+ current to flow even in the absence of excitatory synapitic input.

Even cells that are similar morphologically can differ importantly in molecular details. For exmaple, they can have different combinations of ion channels. We'll see in later chapters that different ion channels provide neurons **variance** in their properties:   their thresholds, excitability, and firing patterns. By extension, neurons with different ion channels can encode synaptic potentials into different firing patterns, transforming the information.

Neurons also differ in the chemical substances they use as transmitters, and in the receptors that receive transmitters from other neurons. Many drugs act on the brain by **modifying** the actions of specific chemical transmitters and receptors.

Because of physiological differences among neurons, a disease may affect one type of neuron and not others. For example, certain diseases strike only motor neurons (e.g. polio), whereas others strike mostly sensory neurons (e.g. syphillis). Parkinsons, a disorder that causes loss of *voluntary* movement, is a disease that strikes a small population of interneurons that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter. Some diseases are even more slective, targeting only a specific part of the neuron such as their cell body or axon. Because the nervous system has so many cell types and variation at the molecular level, it is susceptible to a wider variety of diseases than any other organ system of the body. 

Despite the differences among neurons, the basic mechanics of electrical signaling are surprisingly similar. It makes understanding the molecular mechanisms of singaling much easier, as we really only need to understand it once to apply it everwhere.

## Neural Networks: Parallel Processing

Interactions between just a few types of nerve cells can make up a functional circuit that produces a simple behavior. Can individual neurons implicated in complex behavior be identified with the same precision?

In invertebrates (and some lower-order vertebrates), a single cell can initiate a complex behavioral sequence. As far as we know, no complex human behavior can be initiated by a single neuron. Rather, each behavior is generated by the acitons of many cells. Each of our 3 components of neural processing (sensory input, intermediate processing, and motor output) is mediated by at least a group of neurons, often several distinct groups.

Moreover, each component may have multiple neural pathways that simulataneously provide similar or even the same information. The development of these similar pathways is called **parallel processing**. Parallel processing can also occur in a *single* pathway when different neurons in the pathway perform similar computations at the same time.

Parallely processing makes a lot of sense as an evolutionary strategy for building a more powerful brain; it increases both the speed and reliability of the pathway's function.

The importance of abundant, highly-specific parallel connections has long been recognized as a key feature of our brain's intelligence. In artificial intelligence, the first models used serial processing. They performed well at things like chess, but failed at things like recognizing faces. Modern artificial intelligence uses new models called neural networks. In these models, elements of the system process information simultaneously using both feed-forward and feedback connections. Interestingly, in systems with feedback cicuits, it is the dynamic activity of the system that determines its accuracy, not its inputs or parameters.

Neural networks capture very well the highly recurrent architecture of most actual neural circuits, as well as the ability of the brain to function in the absence of specific sesnory input from outside the body (like we do in thinking and sleep). We will discuss neural networks in the last sections of this guide, and dive much deeper in the "Computational Neuroscience" guide.

What makes the brain a remarkable information processor is not the complexity of its neurons, but the fact it has many elements interconnected in a variety of complex ways.

## Synapses: Modified by Experience

Possibly the most important feature of our brain is that neural connections can be modified by experience. Most learning results in changes that last for years, but even simple connections like reflexes can be modified briefly. But if behavior is learned, an interesting question arises: How can behavior be modified if the brain is wired so precisely. How can changes occur when the connections between neurons are set during early development?

The answer was first proposed by Ramon y Cajal in the 1900's, and formalized by Jerzy Konorski: An answer called the **plasticity hypothesis**:

* "The presence of a stimulus leads to two kinds of changes in the brain. The first property comes as neurons *react* to the incoming impulse, known as *excitability*. The changes arising from this are **changes due to excitability**. The second property is from when certain permanent functional transformations arise as a result of appropriate stimuli or their combination. This property is called **plasticity**, referring to the plastic changes that occur."

To put it simply, there is functional plasticity at the chemical synapses; Changes in synaptic strength (increases and decreases in synaptic effecitveness) occur frequently. Synapses often have a remarkable capacity for short-term physiological changes (lasting seconds to hours) that increase or decrease synaptic effectiveness. Long-term changes, lasting sometimes days, can give rise to further physiological changes that lead to actual anatomical alterations such as pruning of pre-existing synapses and even the growth of new ones.

We will see in later chapters that the chemical synapses are functionally, and by extension anatomically, modified through experience and learning throughout our lives as much as they are during early development. 

**Functional alterations** and **physiological changes** are typically **short-term** and result in chagnes in the effectiveness of existing synaptic connections. **Anatomical alterations** are typically **long-term** and consist of the growth of new synaptic connections between neurons. It is this functional plasticity of neurons that gives each of us our individuality.
 
# Genes

All behaviors are shaped by the interplay between **genes** and the **environment**. The most stereotypical behaviors of simple animals are molded by the enivonment. The highly evolved behviors of humans are determined by the innate properties specified in their genes.

Genes do not control behanvior directly, but the RNAs and proteins encoded by genes act at different times and at many levels to affect the brain greatly. Genes specify the developmental programs that assemble the brain, and are essential to making the properties of neurons and synapses that allow for neural circuits to function. Genes that have been stably inherited over generations create the machinery that allows new experiences to change the brain during learning.

In this chapter, we'll learn how genes contribute to behavior. We're going to dive pretty deep into the cellular biology. It's not a section crucial to understanding how the brain works, but it will give you an understanding of how a brain is built from cellular blueprints.

Recent progress has revealed the genetic basis of some developmental and psychiatric disorders.

## Genes: Heritability of Behavior

Many psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases have genetic components. It's indisputable that relatives of a patient with a disorder are more likely than the average person to have the disorder. The extent to which genertic factors account for traits is called **heritability**.

Identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that splits into two shortly after fertilization. They have the same zygote, and are called monozygotic twins. Such twins share all genes. In contrast, fraternal twins develop from two different fertilized eggs and are called dizygotic twins. Like normal siblings, they share on average half of their genetic information. Identical twins that live in separate environments have been shown to develop the same psychiatric disorders.

Heritability for behvioral traits is usually far less than 100%, demonstrating that environment is an important factor in acquiring diseases or traits. 

## The Nature of the Gene

The fields of molecular biology and transmission genetics are central to our understanding of genes. This guide isn't about molecular biology, but we'll give a primer here. Strap in.

Genes are made of **DNA**. It is DNA that is passed from one generation to the next. Through DNA replication, exact copies of each gene are provided to all cells in an organism. These exact copies will also be provided to succeeding generations.

DNA is made of two strands, each of which has a deoxyribose-phosphate backbone attached to a series of four subunits. I'm sure you've heard of these units: the nucleotides of adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). The two strands are paired so that an A on one strand is always paired with a T on the completementary strand, and a G always with a C. This complementary principle ensures accurate copying of DNA during DNA replication, as well as drives **transcription** of DNA into RNA.

RNA is like DNA, but has a few different biological properties. It is single-stranded and has a ribose rather than a deoxyribose backbone. It also uses the nucleotide uridine (U) instead of thymine (T). Functionally, DNA acts as the data store, and RNA acts as the retrieval mechanism, converting the instructions stored in DNA into usable proteins.

Most genes encode protein products, generated by **translation** of a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into the protein sequence which is composed of 20 different amino acids. A typical gene consists of a coding region, which is what gets translated into a protein, and noncoding regions. The coding region is usually broken into small segments called **exons** that are separated by non-coding stretches called **introns**. Introns are deleted from the mRNA before its translation into protein.

Each cell in the body contains the DNA for every gene, but only expresses a specific subset of the genes as RNAs. The part of the gene that gets transcribed into RNA is surrounded by non-coding DNA regions. These regions are called **promoters** and **enhancers** as they allow accurate expression of the RNA in the right cells at the right time. A unique complement of DNA-binding proteins within each cell interacts with promoters and enhancers to regulate gene expression and resulting cellular properties. in short, promoters and enhancers enable **selective gene expression**

The brain expresses a greater number of genes than any other organ in the body. Within the brain, diverse populations of neurons express different groups of genes. The selective gene expression controlled by promoters, enhancers, and DNA-binding proteins permits a fixed number of genes to generate a vastly larger number of neuron types and connections in the brain.

Although genes specify the initila development and properties of the brain, the experience of an individual and the resulting activity in specific neural circuits can itself alter the expression of genes. In this way, a human's environment is incorporated into the structure and function of neural circuits.

## Chromosomes

The genes in a cell are arranged in an orderly fashion on long, linear stretches of DNA called chromosomes. Each gene in the human genome is located at a characteristic position on a specific chromosom. This genetic "address" can be used to associate biological traits with a gene's effects. 

Most multicellular organisms are **diploid**, meaning every cell in the human body carries two complete sets of chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father. Humans have about 25,000 genes, but only 46 chromosomes. 44 of these (22 pairs) are autosomes (genderless), and 2 (1 pair) are sex chromosomes. Each parent supplies one copy of each autosome to the child. If the sex chromosome is XY male, the X comes from the mother and the Y comes from the father. Because the X is gotten from the mother, genetic diseases that only happen in males can be passed from mother to son.

In addition to genes on the chromosomes, a small number of the organism's genes are transmitted through mitochondria which carry out metabolic processes. Mitochondira in all children come from the ovum, and therfore from the mother to child. Certain disorders, including mental retardation, can come from mutations to the mitochondria DNA

## Genotypes and Phenotypes

Because an individual has two copies of each autosomal gene, it's important to distinguish the **genotype** (an organism's genetic makeup) and the **phenotype** (an organism's appearance). The two copies of a particular gene are called **alleles**. If the two alleles are identical, the individual is homozygous for that gene. If the alleles vary because of mutations, the individual is heterozygous for that gene. Males are hemizygous for genes on the X chromosome.

A population can have a large number of alleles of a gene. For example, a signle gene that affects human eye color can have alleles that encode shades of blue, green, hazel, brown, etc. In the broad sense, a genotype is the entire set of alleles forming the genome of an individual. By contrast, a phenotype is a description of a whole organism, and is a result of the expression of the organism's genotype in its environment.

The differences between genotypes and phenotypes are easier to see in the context of having one normal allele and one mutant allele on a gene. Most proteins are able to function even if only half their normal allele levels are present; inactivating one copy of most genes doesn't lead to a change in phenotype. Thus, two organisms with different genotypes can have the same pheotype. Only organisms with two mutant alleles will ahve a different phenotype. The phenotype of an animal can change over its lifetime, whereas the genotype remains constant (excluding mutations from cancer). 

If a mutant phenotype is expressed only when both alleles of a gene are mutated, the phenotypic trait and the mutant allele are **recessive**. Recessive mutations usually result from a loss/deficiency of a protein. If a mutant phenotype results from the combination of one mutant and one normal allele, the phenotypic trait and the mutant allele are **dominant**. In general, dominant mutations are rarer than recessive ones. Some mutations are dominant because 50% of the gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype. Other dominant mutations lead to the production of an abnormal protein by the mutant gene, or to expression of the wild-type gene product at a bad time.

Genes and proteins are resilient to small changes, so not every sequence change in a gene is debilitating. Most mutations are simply allelic polymorphisms that are silent; They don't have any effect on the phenotype. Some are not silent, but are still benign (e.g. eye color). Only rare mutations cause disturbance in development, cell function, and behvior. Some mutations however are pathogenic and can lead to disease.

## Mutations

Although DNA replication is generally carried out with high accuracy, spontaneous errors called **mutations** do occur. Mutations can result from a whole host of different problems: damage to the purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA, mistakes during the DNA replication process, recombinations that occur during meiosis, etc. It is these mutations that give rise to genetic changes, and by extension evolution as a whole.

The rate of spontaneously ocurring mutations is low but measurable. Spontaneous mutations make a significant contribution to genetic disease. Mutations can be caused in great volume due to exposure to chemical mutagens or ionizing radiation. Chemical mutagens tend to induce **point mutations**, involving changes to a single DNA base pair or the deletion of a few base pairs. Radiations tend to induce large insertions, deletions, or translocations. Both spontaneous and induced mutations can lead to changes in the structure of the protein encoded by the gene, or to a partial decrease of the gene expression.

Functional changes in a single base pair within a coding region can be of three kinds:
1. A **missense mutation**, where the point mutation results in one amino acid in a protein being subtituted for another
2. A **nonsense mutation**, where a triplit of nucleotides within the coding region is replaced by a stop triplet resulting in a truncated protein product
3. A **frame-shift mutation**, in which small insertions or deletions of nucleotides change the reading frame, leading to the production of an abnormal protein

Large-scale mutations involve changes in chromosome structure that can affect the function of genes. Such mutations include the rearrangement of genes, or deletion/duplication of genes in a chromosome.

Although most single-gene traits are recessive, rearrangements that lead to deletion or duplication of multiple genes often have dominant effects. For example, Down syndrome. Individuals with three copies of chromosome 21 have Down syndrome due to the increased expression of multiple genes; no single gene when present in three copies can have such broad cognitive and physical manifestations as Down syndrome.
