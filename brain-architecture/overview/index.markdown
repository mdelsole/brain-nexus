# Introduction

Welcome to the brain architecture section! Here, we will learn everything humans know about how our brain works.

# The Brain

The brain is an extremely large system. At its most basic level, it is made up of **neurons**. These are the basic computational unit of the brain. A neuron by itself is quite usless; only when it is connected to another neuron via **synapses** does it start to have functionality. The brain has over 10,000,000,000 of these neurons, each interacting with each other with about 10,000 synapses. That's over 1 trillion different connections! 

Obviously, it would be impossible to try to understand what each individual neuron in the brain does. Fortunately for us, the brain has a *core set of principles* that it operates with. Most of our neural processing comes from a few simple mechanics repeated over and over. Throughout this section, we'll learn how this core set of principles emerges from the basic biological properties of neurons and synapses.

# Parts of the Brain

The brain has two main parts: the "new" brain, called the **neocortex**, and the "old" brain, which is everything not in the neocortex. The distinction between these two is fundamental to understanding how exactly we humans operate.

Most of our intelligence comes from the neocortex. Meanwhile, most of our basic life functions come from our
