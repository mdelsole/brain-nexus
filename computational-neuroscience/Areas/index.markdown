Welcome to part 2 of this guide. Here, we'll learn about the large-scale picture of the brain.

## Anatomy

There are 8 main parts of the brain we're concerned about:

1. **Cerebral Cortex**: Thought and Planning
    * Most of the cerebral cortex is the neocortex. We usually just refer to it as "cortex".
2. **Thalamus**: Gateway from rest of the body into the cerebral cortex
3. **Basal Ganglia**: Choose which actions to perform
    * Communicates via the thalamus with the frontal cortex, which is in charge of motor processing
4. **Hypothalamus**: Regulates body function
    * Takes care of basic life and survival (sleep, hunger, fight or flight, etc.)
5. **Amygdala**: Emotion
    * Recognizes opportunity, emotion. What you think of with the "limbic system"
6. **Hippocampus**: Episodic memory
    * Tiny in comparison to the cortex, but every episodic memory is reliant on this
7. **Cerebellum**: Fine motor control, movement
    * Contains about half the neurons of the human brain
    * Teaches the cortex
8. **Brain Stem**: Lower level life and motor functions. 
    * Contains three parts: The pons, medualla, and midbrain
    * The midbrain produces the neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin.
    
You can further subdivide the cortex into a number of specialized brain areas. Many of them are named after the famous neurologist Korbinian Brodmann, one of the first to try isolating every area of the brain into specialized functions. Of course, many areas contribute to particular functions, and particular areas contribute to many functions. There is some degree of functional specialization, but it's by no means complete specialization. As usual, it is a **distributed representation**.
