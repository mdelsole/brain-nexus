When we think "executive", we're thinking about what exactly is in charge of our brain. The answer, as it turns out, is the **prefrontal cortex** (PFC). It's an overly simplistic answer, but an accurate answer nonetheless. The PFC is associated with cognitive control, planning, motivation, reward processing, and decision making.

The PFC is composed of a few different regions. The largest in humans is the dorsal-lateral PFC (dlPFC). The other areas that make up the PFC are the ventro-medial PFC (vmPFC), the supplementary motor area, and the motor area. It has special direct connections to motor commands.

The cingulate also has part of itself in the prefrontal cortex, and the rest in the back of the cortex.

The key question is what makes this system tick. The key idea of the PFC is **top-down biasing**. If you're going to be an executive control system in the brain, you need to be in a position to exert influence over neural processing elsewhere in the brain. This happens not only through connectivity to the lower regions, but the ability to **sustain** activity over time (working memory).

The PFC has this broad connectivity; it's in a position at the top of the cortical heirarchy to provide the top-down biasing. But even if it's able to act as the boss, what makes the boss so smart? Well, it takes a network. All the different components of the brain work together.

The PFC provides top-down input of what should be focused on; task-based attention. The PFC gets these answers a lot from the basal ganglia, which tells the PFC what actions/plans/goals are useful. This is a big part of the intelligence: learning over time what works and what doesn't work.

## Active Maintenance

The number 1 thing that we can understand in addition to the top-down biasing is that the PFC provides **active maintenance**. Also known as working memory, this a mechanism through which neural activity is maintained over short periods of time.

With this principle of active maintenance in mind, we can begin to undestand all of the things that the PFC is able to do:
* Cognitive Control = Maintained activity drives top-down biasing
* Planning = Thinking about things that are not there (future)
* Motivation = Maintain goals
* Reward Processing = Maintain possible outcomes
* Decision Making = Maintain alternatives

When you sleep, your PFC is mostly inactive. This is when you get the signature behavior of dreams where everything is pretty much rambling and uncoordinated, with events having no connection to each other. This helps us see that the PFC is a strict task-master, helping keep things on-topic.
