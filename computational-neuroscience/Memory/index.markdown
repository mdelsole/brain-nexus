# Major Types of Memory

Two neural forms of memory: Activation and Synaptic Changes

Activation: Neurons continue to fire action potentials, "remembering" what you were just seeing, thinking. When the firing stops, you forget. Transient, easily lost, but is very flexible (mental arithmetic, etc.). Fundamental basis of working memory.

Synaptic weight changes: Weight changes as a result of LTP, encodes long-term memory that lasts even after activation switches. Very high capacity, as you have so many synapses. Fundamental basis of long-term memory.

## STM Vs. LTM

Sensory Input -> Sensory Memory --(attention)-> STM --(encoding)-> LTM

1. Sensory Input
2. Sensory memory
    * Activity in sensory processing areas
    * Short-term trace of the sensory input; residual activity (e.g. closing your eyes and still seeing shapes)
    * Loses unattended info
3. STM (short-term memoryl, i.e. working memory)
    * Activity in higher-level areas
    * Semantic representations (e.g. "cat")
    * Need rehearsal to maintain information
    * Loses unrehearsed info
4. LTM (long-term memory)
    * Synaptic changes in hippocampus and slower cortical changes
    * Long-term memory is stored in the cortex; it doesn't have an off-site storage
    * Short-term memory is just the active portion of your long-term memory
    * Hippocampus stores episodic memories, but the knowledge is out there in your cortex
    * Loses info from interference 
    
## Memory in the Brain

The brain IS memory. Memory is located in every single synapse in the brain. This is one of the main differences between brains and computers: neurons have the processing and the memory in the same place, the connections between the neurons. It's not a separate thing like it is in computers.

There's as many different kinds of memory as there are neurons and synapses and brain areas.

Sensory memory is just neural firing in the sensory brain. Short-term memory is neural firing in higher level brain areas that represent the specific thing you're remembering. Long-term memory is everywhere; it's the sum of all the information stored in your synaptic weights. There's no "grandmother cell" for every memory, it's just synaptic weight changes

We're consciously aware of things from our temporal lobe more so than from our parietal lobe due to the temporal lobe housing things that can be easily described by language (in addition to housing language itself).

Tpyes of Memory:
* Episodic memory: events, facts, etc.
      * Hippocampus
* Familiarity-based recognition
      * Perirhinal cortex
* Weight-based priming
      * Subconscious, can be very long-lasting
* Weight-based priming
      * Also subconscious, but transient

## Long-Term Memory

In the classic model, there are two types of long-term memory:

* Explicit (declarative)  memory: Conscious
   * Episodic memory (personal experience)
   * Semantic memory (facts about the world)
* Implicit memory: Not conscious
   * Procedural memory (how to do things)
   * Repetition (improvement from exposure)
   * Priming, conditioning 
   
While this model is intuitive, it's very egocentric. It's another one of these psycology models made be people who don't have a deep understanding of the brain and beleive consciousness is all there is.
