I'll fix the link when I get to this section

# The Neocortex
The neocortex is where the real magic of human intelligence happens.

In this guide, instead of breaking things into sections of the brain and what mental functions they contribute to, we’ll break things into mental functions and what sections of the brain they involve.

The neocortex’s rapid evolution is what we can attribute our success as humans to. All mammals have a neocortex, but the human neocortex is much more elaborate than, say, the rat’s neocortex. What made this rapid evolution possible is that the neocortex is essentially the same everywhere. It has many different areas, but they all share one common architecture. The only difference is what the areas are hooked up to.

To show you just how uniform it is, we can take a look at a study done by Sharma et al. [1]. Here, they took the retinal signals from the eyes of ferrets and hooked them up to the auditory pathway, the region of the neocortex involved in processing sounds. Amazingly, the ferrets could learn to see. This is only possible because the way the neocortex learns is the same everywhere.

This is good news for us who want to understand the brain because it means there’s really only one central learning algorithm responsible for our ability to understand things, even if it’s complicated.

We’ll see throughout this guide that the neocortex interacts with the old brain to give us the full range of mental functions we enjoy. Both are parts of the brain are equally important to human survival, but the neocortex is much more important to human intelligence.
