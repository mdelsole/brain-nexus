# Introduction

In this section on computational neuroscience, we'll focus on a single question: How do you build a brain? This is of course a loaded question, and many smart people have tried and failed for hundreds of years to fully understand how the brain works.

To fully understand something, you have to take it apart, and then put it back together. We're going to do just that. In the *Brain Architecture* guide we learned the **biological** properties of every aspect of the brain. Here, we're going to learn the **computational** properties of every aspect of the brain; the *emergent phenomenon* created by the sum of the biological properties. Then, we'll put each of those pieces together and see the emergent phenomenon created by those pieces interacting with each other, producing everything the brain is capable of doing.

The big challenge with understanding the brain is it is incredibly complex. It has over 85 billion neurons! Obviously, we can't build each individual neuron by hand. The good news is that complexity emerges from simplicity. The complex behavior that people don't think they can ever understand is actually the result of just a few simple mechanisms interacting together, created by the intrinsic biological properties of neurons and their synapses. 

In part 1 of this guide, we will first lay out a **core set of principles** for how the brain works. We'll understand how neurons take information, integrate it, and communicate it through synapses. We'll understand how the connections between these neurons develop and how they give rise to the much more complex phenomenon.

In part 2 of this guide, we'll focus on the phenomenon that emerge from these principles, the architecture that gives rise to our higher-level mental functions. We'll learn how perception, motor skills, language, memory, and even our executive consciousness come from the interaction of these principles.

The seat of intelligence in the human brain is the **neocortex**. The neocortex’s rapid evolution is what we can attribute our success as humans to. All mammals have a neocortex, but the human neocortex is much more elaborate than, say, the rat’s neocortex. What made this rapid evolution possible is that the neocortex is essentially the **same** everywhere. It has many different areas all specialized in different things, but they all share common architecture.

When I refer to neurons and synapses in this guide, I mean neocortical neurons and synapses. Neurons elsewhere in the brain sometimes follow different rules, which I'll be sure to differentiate. But for our purposes of understanding how to get our higher-level mental functions to emerge, the neocortex will be our focus.
