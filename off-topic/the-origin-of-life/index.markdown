# Introduction

The human brain is one of the most complex objects in the universe. But how exactly did it come to be? Is it the result of billions of years of evolution? Or do we have a creator to thank? 

Many find it difficult to believe such an intricate piece of machinery capable of emotions, intelligence, understanding, and so much more could have evolved naturally on its own. They say its simply too complex to be the product of chance. It must have been designed by someone else, an all-powerful being who lurks beyond our comprehension.

On the flip side, the theory of evolution has been presented by many scientists, touted as the end-all be-all for how life emerged. But some find their explanations unconvincing. How did the first life come from non-life? How did simple molecules create a being capable of love? If life can happen so naturally, why haven't we found it anywhere else in the universe?

These are all questions I hope to explore here. We will discuss the evidence of history that led up to the incredible learning machine we all have today. As always, the final conclusion is yours to make; all we'll do here is present the evidence.

# The Beginning

One of the most often asked and perhaps most important questions is: How did the first living things emerged from non-living things? After all, something can't come from nothing, right? To answer this, we'll want to trace our evolutionary tree as far back as it will go, and find the most basic form of life that we possibly can.

## What is Life?

Before doing this though, we should try to define what exactly we mean by "life". The single-most important aspect of a living thing is its ability to **self-replicate**. Everything we consider to be life has this ability, from single-celled organisms to mammals. This ability is the builiding block of life. So to find the most basic form of life, we need to find the most basic *thing* that has this ability.

Why is this ability so important? Because it keeps the organism alive for much, much longer. If an organism manages to produce two copies of itself before it dies, it'll live for as long as those two copies live. If those two copies each make two more copies, the chances of the organism as a whole (which is now becoming a **species**) surviving go way up.

The second reason why this ability is so important is because it **enables evolution**. Chemical reactions don't always happen exactly as planned, especially when the outside world is extremely turbulent. Because of this, things can go wrong when and organism tries to reproduce, and we end up with **mutations**. The new copy produced is not an exact copy; some things are different. 

If these mutations are helpful, or at the very least don't hinder the survival of the organism, then the mutated copy can go on to reproduce itself. And once this mutated copy starts being able to reproduce, we have ourselves a new branch of the evolutionary tree. It's important to remember that there's no premeditated thought of "these mutations are helpful, this should be the organism to continue living." It's simply whether or not the organism survived that determines whether it continues to exist. If a mutated copy had helpful mutations, but a freak accident killed it off, that evolutionary branch would die regardless of the fact it was better.

By enabling evolution, reproduction also allows an organism to **adapt to its environment**. Mutations are random, but as time progresses mutated copies with mutations that were helpful to the organisms survival will survive in greater numbers, while copies without the mutations will survive with fewer numbers. Over thousands of years, the old un-mutated copies will die out, and the mutated copies that had traits favorable to the environment will have survived.

By enabling adaptation to the environment, reproduction allows the organism (now species) to live for much, much longer. It becomes a cycle: reproduction enables evolution, which enables better surivival, which enables more reproduction, etc. It all serves one goal: to keep the species alive. The purpose of life, if there is one, could be arguably be *to continue living*. In humans love enables reproduction, so as cliche as it sounds, the purpose of life is love.

## The First Organisms

Now that we've established some criteria for life, we can try to understand how the first life came from non-life.

# Evolution: Working our way up the Tree

## Which Came First: The Chicken or the Egg?

This age-old question actually has a relatively simple answer, and sums up the process of evolution quite nicely.

## Natural Selection
