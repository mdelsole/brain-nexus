# Abstract

One of the most important abilities of humans is the ability to group items and events into functional **categories**. It is made possible by plasticity in many different neural regions: Neocortical regions (sensory, prefrontal, parietal, and motor cortices), the medial temporal lobe, the basal ganglia, and the midbrain dopaminergic systems. These systems all *interact* during category learning.

Loops between the cortex and the striatum (a.k.a. corticostriatal) help mediate recursive interactions between the fast reward-gated plasticity in the basal ganglia and the slow reward-shaded plasticity in the cortex. This can provide a balance between the acquisition of **detailed experiences** and **generalization** across them. Interactions between the corticostriatal loops can integrate perceptual, response, and feedback-related aspects of the task and mediate the shift from novice to skilled performance. 

The basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe interact either competitively or cooperatively, depending on the demands of the learning task.

# Introduction

Although our brains have the power to store *specific* experiences, it it not always the optimal strategy. A brain limited to storing an independent record of each individual experience would not only require an extremely large amount of storage, but would bog us down with unnecessary details.

Instead, we have evolved to be able to detect the **higher-level structure** of experiences, able to pick out the *commonalities* across them that enable us to group experiences into meaningful categories and concepts. It is through this process that we are able to give our experiences meaning. 

This ability enables us to instantly recognize and respond appropriately to objects, situations, sounds, etc., even if we have never encountered those exact examples before. It encourages proactive, goal-directed thought, allowing us to generalize about future situations that share fundamental elements with past experiences (imagination). Without this ability to generalize across experiences, the world would lack any deeper meaning.

# Brain Areas Involved in Category Learning

Categories are our knowledge of patterns. The grouping occurs at all levels of processing, from basic bottom-up visual inputs to abstract ideas such as peace and love. 

Given the wide variety of our ability to categorize, it follows that the ability involves many different brain regions. Most of the **neocortex**, the **hippocampus**, and the **basal ganglia** are recruited in category tasks. Additionally the **amygdala** participates in the generalization of knowledge about *fear-invoking* stimuli.

## Visual Cortex

The visual system is one of the best-studied modalities. However, the general principle of the neocortex is that all regions are the same, so everything that applies to the visual cortex also applies to the other sensory regions (the auditory system, the somatosensory system, etc.).

As the visual cortex is organized into a hierarchy, visual categorization happens at the highest levels. The **inferior temporal cortex** (IT) is an area whose neurons are selective to complex shapes. A specialized area of IT is the **fusiform face area** (FFA), which is an area whose cells are recruited during the learning of new face categories. 

IT however plays less of a role in learning explicit representations of category membership and more of a role in high-level analyis of *features* that contribute to categorization. IT neurons don't often completely generalize among category members; they are selective for the underlying perceptual similarity. Additionally, the emphasize certain critical stimuli and show greater activity for stimuli near category boundaries.

Looking closer at the visual heirarchy reveals that almost the entire pathway is involved in categorization. Earlier visual areas form categories for simple shapes, and in V1, the earliest visual area, categories for line segments are formed.
