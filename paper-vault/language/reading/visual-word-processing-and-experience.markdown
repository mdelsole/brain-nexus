# Abstract

How do category-selective regions arise in the human extrastriate cortex? 

Visually presented words provide an ideal test of the role of **experience**. Our species has only been reading for a few thousand years, **not long enough** for natural selection to produce a genetically specified mechanism dedicated to visual word recognition. 

We identified a small region of cortex that responds selectively to both visually presented words and consonant strings, compared with line drawings, digit strings, and Chinese characters. Critically, we show that this pattern of selectivity is **dependent on experience with specific languages**; The same region responds more strongly to Hebrew words in Hebrew readers than in nonreaders of Hebrew. 

These results indicate that **extensive experience** with a given visual category can produce strong selectivity for that category in discrete cortical regions.
