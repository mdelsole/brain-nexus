# Abstract

Historically, it has been argued that face individuation develops **very slowly**, not reaching adult levels until adolescence. Experience was thought to be the driving force behind this improvement. Here, we challenge this view. 

Results demonstrate **presence of all key phenomena** related to face individuation in children 3-5, often even in infancy:
 * Ecoding of novel faces
 * Holistic processing effects
 * Face-space effects
 * Face-selective responses

We review genetic and innate contributions to face individuation. We conclude that **the role of experience** in the development of the mechanisms of face identification has been **overestimated**. Mechanisms supporting face individuation are **mature early**, consistent with the social needs of children for reliable person identification in everyday life, and are also driven to an important extent by our evolutionary history.

# Introduction

Adults can identify a specific face despite wide variations in facial appearance that result from changes in viewpoint, lighting, emotional expression, etc. All this is done with a mere glance, demonstrating the substantial computational demands that underlie the ability. 

The ability to individuate thousands of faces is supported by **specialized perceptual processes**, typically applied to faces but not other visual objects, and by specialized face-selective regions of cortex. The question is, how do these processes develop? 

Traditionally, our face recognition skills have been viewed primarily as the result of **extensive experience** during infancy, childhood, and adolescence, with adult-like abilities emerging relatively late in development. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, an extreme version of this late maturity view was dominant, which proposed that specialized mechanisms of face perception were not even qualitatively present until 10 years of age, and that extended lifetime experience with faces was driving this slow development (Carey & Diamond, 1994). This was taken as consistent with claimed evidence that, with enough experience (e.g., 10 years) of making within-class discriminations, other object classes (e.g., dogs) could become “special” and processed like faces (Diamond & Carey, 1986; but see Brants, Wagemans, & Op de Beeck, 2011; Harel, Gilaie-Dotan, Malach, & Bentin, 2010; McKone, et al., 2007; Robbins & McKone, 2007). From the mid-1990s on, new evidence that many aspects of face processing were qualitatively present at younger ages forced a modification of the late maturity view, with theoreticians proposing only late quantitative maturity of a subset of aspects of face perception (Mondloch, Le Grand, & Maurer, 2002). However, the driver of this late maturity was still extended experience. Thus, over the past 35 years, it has been argued that adult-like face recognition does not reach full maturity until adolescence, and that the causal mechanism for this maturity was 10 or more years of practice. In this review, we argue that modern evidence, and careful attention to methodological issues, supports a very different conclusion. We argue the data no longer support a theory in which the only face representation present at birth is a mere orienting device (Morton & Johnson, 1991), and that good discrimination of individual faces takes many years of practice to achieve. Rather, we argue that adult expertise results from face-specific perceptual mechanisms that require at most 5 or so years of face experience to become fully mature (and possibly less), and that it also has genetic and innate contributions. Our review begins (see following section: “Children reach adult behavioural performance levels very late in development. Why?”) by noting that performance on laboratory tests of face identification improves dramatically throughout childhood and into adolescence, and evaluating two theories of why adult performance is reached so late (general cognitive development theory and face-specific perceptual development theory). The second section (“A role for nature: Genetic contributions and innateness in face individuation”) reviews the evidence of innateness (defined here as “present at birth”) and of genetic determinants of face recognition ability. The third section (“What effects of experience are there?”) describes situations in which experience does influence face recognition, including otherrace effects. We raise several core methodological and logical errors that frequently limit the conclusions that can be drawn from developmental studies of face recognition. These include a failure to make the logical distinction between laboratory performance and actual ability in everyday life (competence); the presence of restrictions of range (including floor or ceiling effects) that prevent valid quantitative comparisons across wide age ranges; and a general observation that task difficulty has a substantial impact on the age at which the task purports the ability to be “mature”. We also raise a more subtle methodological issue affecting the neuroimaging literature—namely, the potential effects of using adult-sized head coils on children in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
