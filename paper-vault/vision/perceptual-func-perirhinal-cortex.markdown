# Introduction

The **perirhinal cortex**, located in the ventromedially in the temporal lobe, is essential for certain types of memory. Removal of the perirhinal cortex yields severe impairments of **stimulus recognition** and **stimulus–stimulus association**. 

Although the perirhinal cortex has long been known to exist, only in the recently has its function been figured out. Initially, it appeared to be a selective role in **visual recognition memory**. Beyond this, however, it has become clear that the perirhinal cortex is much more important than even the hippocampus for some **mnemonic functions**.

The inferior temporal (IT) cortex has long been known to be critical for visual perception and memory. In the 1980s, findings brought one small portion of IT, the **perirhinal cortex**, to the forefront of investigations of learning and memory. First, investigations the perirhinal cortex's anatomical connections led researchers to conclude that this region extends more laterally than previously recognized. Second, several studies revealed that the activity of cells in the perirhinal and neighboring cortical fields reflected the one’s **prior exposure to a visual stimulus**. The phenomenon they found was a **decrement in neuronal firing** on **second and subsequent viewing** of a stimulus. Finally, researchers found that cooling (artificially inhibiting) of IT in monkeys severely disrupted visual recognition memory, as measured by the delayed matching-to-sample task. 

In this article, we review and synthesize findings from many studies in an attempt to elucidate the cognitive functions of the perirhinal cortex, as well as the implications of these findings for the organization of memory.

# Role of the perirhinal cortex in recognition memory

The recent perirhinal cortex interest has been due in part to the assignment of a function: a central, selective role in stimulus recognition. 

Recognition memory is usually assessed using the delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS) procedure. The rules are simple: The animal will be shown sample objects. Then, they will be shown objects to choose from. The rule is to pick objects that were *not* in the sample batch. A variant, the delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) test, makes the rule to pick only objects that *were* in the sample batch.

In 1987, researchers found that manually inhibiting IT, much of which is occupied by the perirhinal cortex, led to severe impairment on DMS. They then showed that removal of the perirhinal cortex together with the parahippocampal cortex produced a severe impairment in both learning the DNMS rule, and in performing DNMS when long delays were interposed between sample and choice. In other words, it was difficult to learn **not** to recognize something.

It was also showed that lesions limited to the perirhinal cortex yielded a recognition deficit almost as severe as the **combined removal** of the entorhinal plus perirhinal cortex, and as that which follows removal of the perirhinal plus parahippocampal cortex. It would seem that the perirhinal cortex was the common theme. The impairment after removal of perirhinal cortex also held for **tactile recognition** (touch), not just visual recognition.

Studies have found at least two ways neurons in the perirhinal cortex (and neighboring cortical fields) support stimulus recognition. First, neurons in the perirhinal cortex have been seen to **reduce** firing during the second or subsequent exposure to a stimulus relative to the first. Neurons showing this "repetition suppression" effect are located only in those areas in the medial temporal lobe that are involved in visual recognition (perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex and TE); they are not in the hippocampus. Second, perirhinal cortical neurons can also have **increased** firing on the second relative to the first viewing, a phenomenon known as the "enhancement effect". 

Both of these supposed short-term memory mechanisms can operate within the perirhinal cortex, depending on what the task demands.
